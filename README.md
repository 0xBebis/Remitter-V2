## Byte Masons Salary Manager
### Use this contract to simplify paying a big team or many people

This update to Remitter V1 changed behavior from "premissionless stream of cash,"
which would have required a DATE+TIME library to make remotely usable, to actual
accounting software, which seeks to record debits and credits managed by an
administrative party (your finance department).

This system isn't trustless or permissionless, but rather practical for
enterprise use. You can manage credits or debits from either party and settle
everything automatically. The events and UX of this software are designed to
align well with off-chain accounting software like Xero or Quickbooks so that
you can leverage their APIs to automatically generate off-chain ledgers for use
by non-crypto-native parties.
